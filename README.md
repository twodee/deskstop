It has been tested on Macintosh OS X Yosemite, Windows 7, and Linux. But it doesn't work on Linux. The Robot class on Linux fails to correctly capture screenshots of transparent windows. See [JDK-6903034](http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=6903034) and [JDK-7043455](http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=7043455).
